# Introduction to React: Assessment

## Overview

For this assesment you will build a fully functional UI using React. It's your
choice what to build as long as you meet the requirements stated below. Sky's the
limit, so have fun!

If you are looking for ideas, you could do worse than parousing
[this list](http://www.programmableweb.com/category/open%20source/apis?category=20318) of
open APIs maintained by the site [_Programmable Web_](http://www.programmableweb.com).

## Requirements

1. Build a front-end application using React.
2. The application should integrate with remote data of some kind.
3. the application should draw on the techniques and patterns learned in the
curriculum.
4. Isolate state at the top of the component hierarchy as much as possible.
5. Use `props` and container/presentational components to achieve the goal of
isolating state at the top of the aplication.
6. The application should involve interaction -- at the very least form submission.
7. Event handling should be smooth and robust. Robust means that where events
fail, that failure should be handled smoothly.
